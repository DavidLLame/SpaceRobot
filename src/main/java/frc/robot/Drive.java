    //and a lot of people use the book.  So, some day, someone else will write a different book and people
    //will start doing it the way that book says.  Also, those conventions are only standard for Java, not
    //for C#.  The C# programmers read different books.

      //like whether you intend to reuse the code somewhere else, versus the chance of making a mistake if code has
      //to change right now, very fast.  For us, we won't reuse the code, and we may very well have to make 
      //changes in a very short time.  If we do it this way, there's a slightly smaller chance of error.
